# AGENTS.md

Operational guide for agents working in this repository.

## Goal

Keep a small, readable, and easy-to-extend Shopify CLI.

## Principles

- prioritize small, maintainable solutions
- avoid premature abstractions
- do not introduce large dependencies for small problems
- keep behavior explicit and names clear
- do not open new areas until the current vertical is closed

## Supported surface

Supported commands and capabilities:

- multi-store configuration
- Shopify authentication with `clientId` and `clientSecret`
- optional legacy `accessToken` compatibility
- `shop info`
- `products list`
- `products get`
- `products search`
- `products create`
- `products update`
- `products publish`
- `products variants update`
- `products delete`
- `orders list`
- `orders get`
- `orders transactions`
- `orders cancel`
- `customers list`
- `customers get`
- `customers search`
- `customers orders`
- `gift-cards list`
- `gift-cards get`
- `gift-cards create`
- `pages list`
- `pages create`
- `blogs list`
- `blogs create-article`
- `financial transactions`
- `financial refund`
- `financial summary`
- `inventory levels`
- `inventory adjust`
- `inventory set`
- `inventory locations`
- `metafields list`
- `metafields get`
- `metafields set`
- `metafields delete`
- `collections list`
- `collections get`
- `collections products`
- `collections update`
- `collections add-products`
- `publications list`
- `discounts list`
- `discounts get`
- `discounts create`
- `fulfillment list`
- `fulfillment create`
- `fulfillment tracking`
- `analytics custom`
- `analytics sales`
- `analytics products`
- `analytics overview`

## Expected structure

- `src/index.ts`: CLI entry point
- `src/config.ts`: read and write `~/.shopfleet/stores.json`, migrating from `~/.store-manager/stores.json` when needed
- `src/client.ts`: token exchange and GraphQL calls
- `src/commands/*`: subcommand definitions
- `src/graphql/*`: pure GraphQL queries
- `src/utils/output.ts`: table and JSON rendering

## Implementation rules

- keep the HTTP client on native `fetch` unless there is a clear need
- pin a default `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION` and allow override through env
- support both `clientId/clientSecret` and `accessToken` in config
- never print secrets in logs or tables
- treat Shopify taxonomy categories as read-only references; product category edits should only assign, replace, filter, or clear the category on a product
- keep publication selection explicit; list publication IDs before publishing a product to a sales channel
- keep analytics on `shopifyqlQuery` and read-only
- do not introduce traffic, conversion, abandonment, marketing analytics, webhooks, or bulk operations unless explicitly requested

## Documentation rules

- all repository documentation must be written in English
- keep `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, help text, and any new docs in English only
- if you edit existing documentation that is not in English, translate it to English in the same change
- write help for agents, not for humans relying on implicit context
- each command must clearly explain what input it expects
- each command must say whether it expects a GID, a numeric ID, or a handle
- each command must include at least one realistic example in `--help`
- when a command has an important precondition, it must appear in `--help`
- when a command contract changes, update code, `--help`, `README.md`, and this file together when applicable
- when a method or command behavior changes, update the corresponding repository skill docs in `skills/` in the same change
- prefer direct, operational language: what it does, what it needs, what it returns
- avoid marketing language or vague descriptions

## CLI help convention

Use `addHelpText("after", ...)` in Commander to add:

1. a short context line
2. copyable examples
3. notes about formats or identifiers when needed

Correct clarity examples:

- `products get` must make it clear whether it accepts a GID, a numeric ID, or `--handle`
- `products create` and `products update` must make it clear that `--category` expects a taxonomy category GID or raw taxonomy category ID
- product status help must include `unlisted` when the pinned Shopify API supports it
- `products publish` must identify the required publication ID, product status precondition, and `write_publications` scope
- `collections update` must make it clear that it accepts a collection GID or numeric ID and that changing the title does not change the handle automatically
- `collections add-products` must state that it accepts GIDs or numeric IDs and only works with custom collections
- `publications list` must mention `read_publications`, product read access for catalog metadata, and its relationship to `products publish`
- `metafields get` and `metafields delete` must make it clear that they expect an owner GID plus a `namespace.key` identifier
- `metafields set` must make it clear that `--entry` expects `namespace.key:type:value`
- `metafields` commands must mention `--current-app-installation` when app-data metafields are relevant
- `config add` must make it clear that `--domain` has to be `*.myshopify.com`

## Workflow

1. Change as little as necessary.
2. Build with `npm run build`.
3. Validate types with `npm run typecheck`.
4. Run tests if they exist.
5. Update documentation and repository skills when a command contract or method changes.

## Mirror documentation

`CLAUDE.md` must point to this same document to avoid divergence.
